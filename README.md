# My Beamer Template

## Overview

This folder is designed to host my customized templates for $\LaTeX$-based documents, i.e. papers, beamer slides, cv, etc. 

## A Technical Note 

It is important to distinguish between `.cls` and `.sty` files. In general, class files (`*.cls`) govern a class of documents (i.e. slides vs. paper) and style files (`*.sty`) determine looks only. That being said, the distinction can get a bit blurry. 

## Inspiration

There are a few repos/ individuals who have inspired this customized template:
