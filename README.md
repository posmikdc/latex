# All Things $LaTeX$

## Overview

This folder is designed to host my all my $\LaTeX$-based assets, i.e. templates, cv, etc. 

## A Technical Note 

It is important to distinguish between `.cls` and `.sty` files. In general, class files (`*.cls`) govern a class of documents (i.e. slides vs. paper) and style files (`*.sty`) determine looks only. That being said, the distinction can get a bit blurry. 

## `beamer`

Contains my customized beamer template, `beamertheme.sty`. 

## `cv`

Contains my CV with my custom cv template, `cv.cls`

## `bib`

Contains a `main.bib` file with my publications.
