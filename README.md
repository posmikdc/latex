# All Things $LaTeX$

## Overview

This folder is designed to host my all my $\LaTeX$-based assets, i.e. templates, cv, etc. 

## A Technical Note 

It is important to distinguish between `.cls` and `.sty` files. In general, class files (`*.cls`) govern a class of documents (i.e. slides vs. paper) and style files (`*.sty`) determine looks only. That being said, the distinction can get a bit blurry. 

## Table of Contents 

### `globals.tex`

Global $\LaTeX$ settings that I want to apply to every `*.tex` file I work with. 

### `beamer`

Contains my customized beamer template, `beamertheme.sty`. 

This file (and its components) is inspired by and modified from: 
 
- Auriga theme (https://github.com/anishathalye/auriga) 
- The Legrand Orange Book (https://www.latextemplates.com/template/legrand-orange-book)

### `cv`

Contains my CV with my custom cv template, `cv.cls`

### `bib`

Contains a `main.bib` file with my publications.

## Use

Please feel free to use any templates that I have created. If you have questions or suggestions, please reach out to me at [posmikdc@gmail.com](mailto:posmikdc@gmail.com).
